WHEN UPDATING FROM 0.8.0:
- YOU WILL NEED TO DECONSTRUCT ALL OLD PLATFORMS.
- Magnesium was renamed to Rhenium to support one more recipe chain, since the mod is alpha no migration code is provided to not accidentally break things in the future.

THIS IS THE SECOND TO LAST BREAKING UPDATE!
The mod's core is functionally complete, there is only one mechanic I want to introduce before release!
No more new machines, only new recipes and tweaks to existing ones.

There is one more world generation change to lemures that is not implemented yet. This is to give you easier access to water.


---
Adds a second smaller solar system to factorio.
#The star
A small withe dwarf, still has a few million years to fully cool down.

#Planet Dea Dia
A resource rich gas giant that most objects in the system orbit around.

- Build on platforms suspended on top of convection currents
- only gas/liquid resources to mine
- Dedicated bot chargers from [Robocharger updated](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Robocharger-Updated)
- [lex's aircraft](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/lex-aircraft) integrated for logistics. (this mod is normally OP, being here gives it some balance and a dedicated usecase)
- an entire crafting chain that I'll let you discover yourself

#Prosephina
A warmer planet, close to the star. Its shallow seas are home to primitive life, most of the raw materials are tied up in the dirt covering its surface.
The development stages of life suggests artificial seeding.

Technologies:
- A machine with engine productivity
- Greenhouses
- insulated pipes that won't freeze in the cold
- huge power poles
- thorium as an alternative nuclear path

#Lemures
A Frozen planet that still has some tidal heating from the gas giant and the star. While cold, patches of lava still dot the surface.
Home to the [cold biters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Cold_biters), pollution is enabled.
Cord biters are set to only exist here, this is a design choice to give them a place where they can be a unique enemy faction.

Technologies:
- lava based heating
- alternative lava processing
- a new lab
- everything from the [cold biters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Cold_biters) mod
- a burner assembler that does not freeze
- [SA atomic tank](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SA-AtomicTank) for combat.


If you add it to an existing save, this mod will put you back into the "mid game", as it includes it's science packs on the promethium research. This is done to make you set up interstellar logistics to ship all the science back to nauvis, mirroring what the DLC wants you to do.

###How I intend this to be played. This is just what I was designing around, at the end of the day you do you. Feel free to ignore this.
- Don't add mods that **only** add alternative recipes. This mod adds some that are designed around the new planets.
- Don't add mods that add more recipes to the DLC machines. I add some of those to mine, and it may break things.
- Mods that modify surface conditions on machines/recipes may also give unintended results.
- Any mods that alter how quality works on labs, especially with science drain. The thermodynamics lab's unique feature is that the science drain is affected by its quality.
- There is a lot content that works on aquillo, it may work as an overhaul for that planet by proxy.
- Anything affecting quality other than maraxsis or corrundum may also break my design. I was building with those two in mind.


I try to ensure that everything in the mod is useful for something, even if only locally.


###Compatibility:
- Full Lignumis compatibility, the science packs won't appear in tech's where it would interfere with progress
- With Maraxsis, I reset the biolab's surface conditions so that it does not invalidate the thermodynamic lab's existence.
